# Steganography
Steganography (US Listeni/ˌstɛ.ɡəˈnɔː.ɡrə.fi/, UK /ˌstɛɡ.əˈnɒɡ.rə.fi/) is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein (γράφειν) meaning "writing".
